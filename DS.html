    <h2>Dark Souls Intro</h2>
    <p>
        Dark Souls: is a series of action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco
        Entertainment.
        It began with the release of Dark Souls (2011) and has seen two sequels, Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III
        (2016).
        The series was created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and has received critical acclaim, with its high level of difficulty
        being among its most discussed aspects, while the first Dark Souls is often cited as one of the greatest games
        of all time.
        By 2023, the series had shipped over 35 million copies outside of Japan. Other FromSoftware games, including
        Demon's Souls,
        Bloodborne, and Elden Ring, share several related concepts and are commonly grouped together as Soulsbornes.

        Setting
        The games take place within a dark, medieval fantasy setting, where the player's character fights against
        knights, dragons, phantoms, demons, and other monstrous or supernatural entities. The accretion, loss, and
        recovery of souls are central to the narrative and gameplay of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through
        their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire, and are linked through common themes
        and elements, including interactions with phantoms and battles with demons.
        At the end of each game, characters may reignite the "first flame" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice
        others have made before. <br><br>
        Gameplay
        See also: Soulslike
        The Dark Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and focus on exploring interconnected
        environments while fighting enemies with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the story,
        while interacting with non-playable characters. The protagonist of each Dark Souls game can have a varying
        gender, appearance, name, and starting class via character creation. Players can choose between classes,
        including knights, barbarians, thieves, and mages. Each class has its own starting equipment and abilities that
        can be tailored to the player's experience and choices as they progress. The player gains souls from gameplay
        battles which act as both experience points to level up and as currency to buy items. Souls gained are usually
        proportional to the difficulty of fighting certain enemies; the more difficult an enemy, the more souls the
        player will gain from defeating it. <br><br>

        One of the core mechanics of the series is the use of how it handles progress, death, and player improvement.
        Bonfires serve as a checkpoint within the series, restoring all health and other critical resources when used,
        but also respawning most enemies and obstacles, making repeated trips back to safety untenable for forward
        progress. Upon losing all of their health points and dying, players lose their souls and appear back at the
        bonfire where theylast rested. If the player can return to their point of death, their bloodstain, without dying
        again, they can regain all lost souls.[1] If the player dies again before reaching their bloodstain, the souls
        are permanently gone.[1] Notably, using a bonfire manually and respawning at one after death have identical
        effects, save for the player losing their currency at their place of death, which can be retrieved with no
        penalty. In this way the player is encouraged to not fear death, as no progress is lost so long as they can
        learn from their mistakes. As the player retraces their steps after death, they will naturally defeat more
        enemies, gaining more souls and allowing their character to gain experience alongside the player themselves.<br>

        Online interaction in the Dark Souls games is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout areas of
        the game, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden
        passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players game world and when
        activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially
        helping other players online to avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the ground that
        can help other players with tips and warnings. Multiplayer can be engaged in both player versus player combat
        and cooperative gameplay using invasion or summoning mechanics.[2][3] Players can also rely on covenants, which
        serve as "factions" that can allow players to delve further into the multiplayer experience.
